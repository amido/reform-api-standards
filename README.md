# Deprecation of APIs or API endpoints

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/reform-api-standards.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmcts/reform-api-standards)

Added an annotation named `@APIDeprecated` for classes and methods that add warning headers to the responses generated by the API.

A typical usage would be to add the @APIDeprecated annotation to a method as in the following example.

```
    @RequestMapping("/deprecated")
    @APIDeprecated(name = "Deprecated Endpoint",
            date = "01/06/2018",
            link = "https://example.org/docs/api/deprecated/",
            note = "Just a note, upgrade your client code!!!")
    public String deprecated() {
        return "Greetings from deprecated Class Controller!";
    }
```
The annotation has the attributes that are used for forming a `Warning` header. 
- `name` for friendly name of the endpoint, 
- `expireDate` for the date which the endpoint will cease to serve, 
- `docLink` for the details of documentation regarding the API updates
- `note` for optional notes to the clients

A sample of the Warning header is as follows:
```
warning â†’The UserProfileEndpoint is deprecated and will be removed by 20/09/2017. Please see https://example.org/docs/api/deprecated/ for details. Just note that
``` 

It is possible to add the `@APIDeprecated` annotation on top of a `@Controller` class to deprecate all the endpoints served by that `@Controller` at once.
``` 
@RestController
@APIDeprecated(name = "Deprecated API set",
        expireDate = "30/09/2018",
        docLink = "https://example.org/docs/api/deprecated/",
        note = "Just a note, upgrade your client code!!!")
public class DeprecatedClassController {

    @RequestMapping("/depclass")
    public String deprecated() {
        return "Greetings from deprecated Class Controller!";
    }

}
```
